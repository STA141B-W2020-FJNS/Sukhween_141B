#Introduction:  
Our app is built for utilizing the Spotify API and performs summary, analysis and data visualization of popular artists and tracks. We built this shiny app under the idea that we want to explore the Spotify database to find interest and top tracks of different genres, analyze albums by your favorite artists, assess the mood of the song, and user’s idea for personal data visualization.  

#Data Description:  
The source of data comes from Spotify API. With the help of Spotifyr package on RStudio (https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/spotifyr/spotifyr.pdf ), we are able to retrieve desired data from Spotify and perform our analysis and data visualization on  audio features of tracks to learn about ist danceability energy, valence and more. We can even read more in-depth analysis data about tracks such as segments, beats, and tatums.

#Data Retrieval and Process:  
User’s analysis: Upon entering the user's credential, we will retrieve their top artist and top tracks and store them in a data table. We utilized ggplot and various coloring for a better data visualization.   

"Most Popular Spotify Tracks per Category":  
The app queries the list of Spotify categories for the United States to create a list of options in the “Category” dropdown menu. When a category is selected, a backend function produces a table of Spotify tracks and gets the IDs of every official playlist on Spotify. The top 100 tracks of each playlist is retrieved, and their IDs, names, artists, and popularity indices. Tracks with duplicate IDs are removed. The artists column is transformed to contain the names of each artist for each track. Then, the table is sorted by track popularity in descending order, and the ID and popularity columns are removed. Once the table is produced, the app fetches the top tracks in the table and displays them. The number of tracks displayed is the value of the “Number of Tracks” slider. If the slider is adjusted, the table is produced again, even if the selected category does not change.  

“Artist Album Analysis”: 
The get_spotify_access_token() was used to create a Spotify access token and get_artist_audio_features() was used to get a data frame of tracks and other attributes from `spotifyr` from a string input of the artist name or the artist Spotify ID . The “formattable”  and “shinydashboard” library is then used to create an aesthetic table, grouped by album names. Many backend calculations were performed, please refer to the code for more detailed notes.  

#User Guide:    
User’s analysis: Users should be able to access the features of our app after clicking on the tab on the navigation bar on the left. If the app is not working correctly, please close it and re-open should resolve the issues.

"Most Popular Spotify Tracks per Category: Designed to give a playlist of popular tracks. 
1) When the user opens the widget, they will see a dropdown menu labeled “Category,” a slider labeled “Number of Tracks,” and a table with columns “name” and “artists.”   
2) The initial value for the menu will be “Top Lists,” the initial value for the slider will be 10, and the table will contain the names and artists of the 10 most popular tracks on Spotify in the “Top Lists” category.     
3) If the user wants to see the 10 most popular tracks on Spotify for a different category, they will select a different category from the dropdown menu. The list consists of all Spotify categories recognized in the United States.   
4) If the user wants to see a different number of the most popular tracks on Spotify for a certain category, they will adjust the slider to the appropriate value. Users can select any number from 1 to 30. The popularity of a Spotify track is determined by Spotify’s track popularity index, which ranges from 0 to 100, and is mainly based on the total number of streams, with more recent streams having a greater effect on the index.  
5)  It should be noted that anytime the category or number of tracks is updated, the resulting table will take anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds to load.
